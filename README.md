# Few-shot-learning-with-Siamese-Networks-Triplet-Loss
## Try to train a Triplet-Siamese-Netwrok with the constrained Triplet Loss for few shot image classification.
### More details in the folder siamese-triplet-master!

Implemented in Pytorch .
Currently I am trying to add a hierarchical meta learning frame to optimize the algorithm on MiniImageNet & Omniglot.

## How to download Omniglot datasets?
Just jump to https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot.

## How to download MiniImageNet dataset?
Go to see the official guide at https://github.com/mini-imagenet-tools.
Then you will have fun with classical meta learning algorithms like MAML, ProtoNets,etc.
.
